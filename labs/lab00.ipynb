    "    We encouage you to do this first, before you complete any other tasks, so that you know that you are sure how to submit on Gradescope, and if you run into any problems, you can ask for help during your assigned discussion section.\n",

If you submit as any other type of file, the most you can get on this lab is 10 points, and you cannot earn any of the rest of the points.  Please use the opportunity in lab to be sure that you know how to download the file from JupyterHub as an .ipynb file and submit it to Gradescope in that format. If you have trouble, please ask the course staff for assistance during discussion, and/or come to office hours and ask for help.\n",

    "3. (10 points) Add one more markdown cell with the heading `# AI Results` where you discuss the results you got from your prompt.\n",

You may also refer to the [introduction to Chapter 8 of the textbook](https://inferentialthinking.com/chapters/08/Functions_and_Tables.html) for an overview of function definitions.  Please let us resassure you though that while we hope you will read that material and try to understand it, for *this* lab, it is sufficient to just copy and paste the code.  We aim this week is just to be sure you understand the mechanics of working with code cells and markdown cells in a Jupyter Notebook.\n",

    "   \n",
    "   Each of these is a Python *function call*, or what our textbook refers to as a *call expression*.  In each case, the function definition is referred to.  The variable `x` takes on the value in the function call (`1`, `2`, `3`, etc.) and the expression after the word `return` is used to calculate the result.  Since that expression is `x * x`, what we get back is the value in the call expression, squared.   So your results should show `1`, `4`, `9`, etc after you enter these code cells, and press `<shift><return>` to evaluate them (i.e. compute their value).\n",
